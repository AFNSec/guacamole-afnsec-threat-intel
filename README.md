# 🛡️ AFNSec Guacamole Threat Intelligence Extension (BETA)

Official binary releases of proprietary **AFNSec** extensions for [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/).  
These add advanced features and customization in Apache Guacamole.
---

## 📘 Overview

The AFNSec Intel Reputation Extension adds real time IP reputation checks and optional GEO policy enforcement to Apache Guacamole. 

It allows Guacamole to call the AFNSec Threat Intelligence API during authentication and block sign ins from malicious or suspicious sources.

This extension provides a simple, API driven layer of protection against credential stuffing, brute force attempts(honeypot hashed password only), and abusive remote access behavior.

## 📦 Current Release

| Extension | Description | Guacamole Version | Release |
|------------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| **guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel** | Provide IP reputation and Geo blocking. | 1.5+| 1.0.0 |


## Features

• Real time IP reputation lookup from the AFNSec API  
• Optional continent and country based GEO blocking  
• Optional hashed password reputation check using AFNSec honeypot data  
• AFNSec styled block screen when a sign in is denied  
• Simple configuration through guacamole.properties  
• Compatible with Apache Guacamole 1.5.x to 1.6.x  

## How it works

During authentication, the extension:

1. Reads the user’s source IP  
2. Queries the AFNSec Intel API  
3. Applies the configured policy (reputation or GEO)  
4. Allows or blocks the login based on the verdict  

No sensitive data or credentials are stored or transmitted.

📥 Download the Extension

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AFNSec/guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.git
```

That will create a local folder:

afnsec-guacamole-extensions/


Move into the specific extension directory
```bash
cd guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel/build/v1.0.0
```

Now you’ll see:

```cli
guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.jar
guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.SHA256
README.md
```

🔐 Verify checksum

```bash
sha256sum -c guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.jar-SHA256
```

Expected output:

guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.jar: OK


If you see “OK,” your file is valid and unmodified.

📦 Install the Extension

Copy the verified JAR into Guacamole’s extension directory:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.jar /etc/guacamole/extensions/
```

🔒 Set Permissions

Make sure Tomcat (or the Guacamole web service) can read the file:

```bash
sudo chown root:tomcat /etc/guacamole/extensions/guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.jar
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/guacamole/extensions/guacamole-afnsec-threat-intel.jar
```

⚙️ Configure guacamole.properties

Add the required AFNSec settings to guacamole.properties (see "guacamole.properties.example" for more):
